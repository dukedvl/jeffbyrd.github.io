``` 
### Lean Six Sigma Continuous Improvement Initiatives
#### Standardizing, Extending, Automating Load-Profile Comparisons
```
Problem: Interval billing testing was time-consuming and manual
Solution: Automated data collection/comparison, introduced more independent data sources, automated reporting.

Reduced 7d manual test effort to 1h automated test effort. Significant morale boost, empowered engineers to parallelize and expand coverage
```
#### Raspberry-Pi Remote Testing "Device-Cloud"
```
VirtualHere (Remote Linux USB) + Raspberry Pi USB-Hubs for building out remote-operation of serial devices,
accessible over the VPN, enabling multiple testbed suites, remote sales demo
```
#### Range-reduction for water-meter Comm devices
```
Problem: Single-channel radios were overlapping common frequencies, requiring all 
testing to be scheduled and non-overlapping between 5-7 testers, single-tests at a time. 

Solution: Antenna shielding 
- Effective range reduced from 400ft to 1ft radius, unblocking all testers (and allowing each individual to multiple instances)
Data-driven approach was measuring effective radius with CommTool and endpoint.
